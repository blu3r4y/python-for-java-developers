### What is Anaconda?

If you intend to use lots of scientific packages, you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) as an alternative.  
`numpy` / `scipy` /  `sympy` /  `tensorflow` / ... usually work out of the box with Anaconda, especially on Windows.

## Jupyter Notebooks

Notebooks let you mix code and documentation, usually for prototyping or documentation purposes.

### Installation

**Jupyter Notebooks** are the "classic" notebooks and **Jupyter Labs** is the new IDE-like successor of them.

```sh
pip install jupyter jupyterlab

# or, if that doesn't work
python -m pip install jupyter jupyterlab
```

### Usage

You may want to open notebook files (`.ipynb`) directly within [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) oder [IntelliJ PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/jupyter-notebook-support.html).  
Alternatively, you can start a stand-alone instance in the browser from the command line.

```sh
python -m juypter notebook [--notebook-dir <path>]
python -m jupyter lab [--notebook-dir <path>]
```
