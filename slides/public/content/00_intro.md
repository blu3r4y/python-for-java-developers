## ðŸ’Ž What is Python?

- a mature, **general-purpose, object-oriented, dynamically-typed** programming language  
  _(Java is statically-typed)_
- released in 1991 _(Java was released in 1995)_
- one of the dominating languages in machine learning, statistics, and data analytics
- popular alternative to MATLAB or Octave
- gaining in popularity year after year

## Comparison to Java

### Similarities

- general-purpose, object-oriented, garbage-collected, large standard library

### Differences

- **dynamically-typed**, and not strongly-typed  
  _(type checks will only happen at runtime)_
- **interpreted with [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython)**, and not just-in-time compiled with a JVM  
  _("more flexibility, but slower execution times")_
- **interactive mode** provided out of the box  
  _("i will show you that soon")_
