## Comparison to Java

### Similarities

- general-purpose, both having a large standard library
- object-oriented
- garbage-collected

### Differences

- **dynamically-typed**, and not strongly-typed  
  _("type checks will only happen at runtime")_
- **interpreted with [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython)**, and not just-in-time compiled with a JVM  
  _("more flexibility, but slower execution times")_
- **interactive mode** provided out of the box  
  _("i will show you that soon")_
