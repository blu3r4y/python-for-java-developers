If you ever need help, type `help` - use the [resources mentioned in the beginning](#-literature) - or, ask Google.

```py
help(sorted)

# > Help on built-in function sorted in module builtins:
# > 
# > sorted(iterable, /, *, key=None, reverse=False)
# >     Return a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order.
# > 
# >     A custom key function can be supplied to customize the sort order, and the
# >     reverse flag can be set to request the result in descending order.
```
