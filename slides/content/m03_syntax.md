### What do we notice here?

- There are no semicolons `;`
- There are no types
- There are no braces `{ }` - but blocks that are started by a colon `:`
- There are no parentheses `( )` around the expressions
- A list - one of many built-in data collections in Python - is initialized with square brackets `[ ]` (actually, there are no arrays in Python)
- The `for` and `if` syntax is slightly different
- Comments are written with the hashtag `#` symbol
